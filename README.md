# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

I found this project very fun to complete. getting everything to look right is something I enjoy I would be content in a career doing this.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

It would be cool and easy to have some more animations throughout the page. The page could also be more responsive to other devices.
