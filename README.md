# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

It would be cool and easy to have some more animations throughout the page. The page could also be more responsive to other devices.

My own program to streamline web design would be an acheivable task in the near future.

I found this project very fun to complete. getting everything to look right is something I enjoy I would be content in a career doing this.
